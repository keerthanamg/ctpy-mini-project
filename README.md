TEXT_BASED ADVENTURE GAME
A Text-Based Adventure Game is a type of game in which a player has to make
choices (Yes / No) in every step of the game. Based on these choices, the storyline changes, and at last, we get to know that
whether the player wins or loses the game.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:TEXT-BASED ADVENTURE GAME
Check for a diagram that is uploaded in this repository which will help you in better understanding the storyline of our game:

As you can see from the above diagram that at the starting of the story, a man came to us and ask for shelter. Now, you get the two options to choose from, which is saying Yes or No to the man. So, if you said yes, then after 2 minutes, the police will come to your house and will ask you whether the thief is inside or not. Now again, you have two options, which is saying Yes or No to the police. So, if you said Yes, then you will win the game. As the man who was asking for shelter is a thief. On the other hand, if you said no, then you will go to Jail and your Game is Over. However, At the starting of the story, if you said “no” to the man who is asking for shelter. Then he will attack you. Now, again you have 2 options, which is knocking him down or not. So, if you knock him down, then you will win the game. Otherwise, he will kill you and you will lose the game.
